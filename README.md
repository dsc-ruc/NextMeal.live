## What is NextMeal.live
    NextMeal.live is a project aimed to end food insecurity by using the problem of resturant food
    waste as a solution. NextMeal.live allows resturants to post what kinds of food they have left
    ove at the end of the day so residents who cannont afford food can pick up the extra food allowing
    them to have some kind of meal at the end of the day.

## Insparation
    We had recently learned that almost 50% of college students are food insecure while our dining hall has
    just gone all you can eat creating an imense amount of food waste. We though that it was crazy that
    there was so much food waste when there was hungry people who can use it. We tried to turn one man's
    problem into another man's solution and use foodwaste to end food insecurity.
